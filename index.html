 <h2>Jason DeCambre</h2>
 <p>I'm a CS major and Economics minor at the UWI Mona. I'm not quite sure if I'm going to go into <br>
    data science or investment management as a career. In any case I'll perhaps look into both for now. <br>
    Outside of school, I like to paint, cook and play guitar. My dad tells me I could have gone to <br>
    culinary school, and I wish I did :). I'd really love to run a Mediterranean bistro one day, so <br>
    I'm all over the place career wise. That's ok since I'm young, so I have time to figure it out.</p>
