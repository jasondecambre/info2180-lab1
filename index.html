 <h2>Jason DeCambre<br>
    ^my name<br>
    I am interested in Web Development because it is a modern, marketable skill. It seemed like a wise <br>
    elective where I could learn and develop these skills while earning computing credits toward my degree.<br>
    I will need to use the skills in my capstone project as well as for the introductory database course,<br>
    so overall this seems like a great course to do.</h2>
 <p>I'm a CS major and Economics minor at the UWI Mona. I'm not quite sure if I'm going to go into <br>
    data science or investment management as a career. In any case I'll perhaps look into both for now. <br>
    Outside of school, I like to paint, cook and play guitar. My dad tells me I could have gone to <br>
    culinary school, and I wish I did :). I'd really love to run a Mediterranean bistro one day, so <br>
    I'm all over the place career wise. That's ok since I'm young, so I have time to figure it out.</p>
